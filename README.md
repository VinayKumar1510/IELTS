# üöÄ IELTS Institute Landing Page

A modern, professional, and fully responsive landing page for a fictional IELTS preparation institute, completed as part of an internship task.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights

This project focuses on **design quality, responsiveness, and clean React code**.

* **Design:** Professional, academic aesthetic using a clean **Red and White** color palette.
* **Responsiveness:** **Mobile-first** approach ensures a seamless experience across all devices.
* **Structure:** Implemented all required sections: **Navbar**, **Hero**, **Feature Cards**, **Testimonials Slider**, and **Footer**.

## üíª Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React JS** | Component-based architecture for modular, reusable code. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first framework for rapid, highly responsive styling. |
| **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** | Adds subtle, professional scroll animations to elements. |
| **Swiper** | Powers the modern, touch-friendly testimonials carousel. |
| **Vite** | Fast development server and optimized build tooling. |
| **`react-scroll`** | Enables smooth navigation between page sections. |

## üí° Design & Code Decisions

I focused on achieving a premium UI/UX:

* **AOS** animations and the **Swiper** carousel were integrated to add a polished, dynamic feel without being distracting.
* The **Navbar** uses a modern, translucent `backdrop-blur-md` effect.
* The application is organized into logical, separate components (`Hero`, `Features`, `Testimonials`, etc.) for **maintainability and clarity**.
